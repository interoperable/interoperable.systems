## About Me
I am a technologist, philosopher with solid experience in the information and telecommunication technology industry for more than 28 years. 
I currently work at Ampere Computing, enabling Open Source Software for Aarch64 servers in the datacenter, and enabling Aarch64 native OSS server based cloud computing.

I previously helped to maintain OpenStack integration with Microsoft's Virtualization platform Hyper-V and was Microsoft's OpenStack subject matter expert.

Prior to Microsoft I worked for Novell in the Joint Interoperabilty Lab with Microsoft.  There our team focused on testing and validating Linux workloads on Hyper-V and Windows workloads on Xen and KVM.  In April 2011 I successfully deployed the first OpenStack Cloud using Hyper-V and began my evangelism for Hyper-V within the OpenStack community. Additional experience includes Devops automation and testing, network and datacenter infrastructure and security, Operating System and Virtualization interoperability.

I arrived at Novell through the acquistion of Ximian, the company that created the commercial linux desktop (Gnome), where I was thier Windows and Microsoft Exchange expert working on the Evolution Connector for Microsoft Exchange, the first email client/group messenger for Linux and Unix to work with Microsoft Exchange.
