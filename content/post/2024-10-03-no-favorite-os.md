## Operating System Facination

When you're the token "Windows" guy at the first linux desktop company, they don't know always know what to do with you.
This lead to being the person who would produce, and to date myself, CDs for the developers to use to install the different OSes which we packaged Gnome for.
At the time I started at Ximian, we repackaged Gnome for 28 different Linux distributions as well as Solaris, and HP-UX.
